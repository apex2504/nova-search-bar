# nova-search-bar
Work around Nova Launcher crashing on MIUI 14 caused by search bars. This will remove Nova's search bar and Google's search bar from your setup. You can still access Search with a gesture or whatever else.

This code isn't really intended to be used outside of the current context. There is a live version of this at https://apex.moe/search-bar which you should use instead.

If you decide to self host regardless, remember to replace [index.html line 109](https://github.com/apex2504/nova-search-bar/blob/master/frontend/index.html#L109) with your API endpoint.

If you'd rather keep your search bars, you can update to Nova Launcher 8 (currently in beta as of 17 July 2023) from the [Nova Launcher Discord](https://discord.gg/novalauncher).
